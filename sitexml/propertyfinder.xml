				<description_en>&lt;![CDATA[Exclusively listed with John at Espace Real Estate is one of the most unique and spectacular homes in the whole of The Meadows community. Located on a larger than average plot of approximately 12,000 sq ft, this excellent family home comprises 5 bedrooms plus maids room and study as well as a swimming pool and outdoor area with breathtaking panoramic views across the lake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is genuinely one of the best and longest lake views available in Dubai and at over half a kilometer, this is a view only available by a few villas in Dubai. As you approach the property, through the security gates, there is a 2 car garage to the left with a large landscaped driveway leading to the front door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upon entering the villa, you will notice the fantastic finishing throughout, that include dark wood flooring and paneling. Immediately to the right is a large bedroom with en-suite, and if you look at floor plans for other L1 you would see this connecting to a small patio area. The previous owners have replaced this patio with an extension to create an extra living room which contributes to the increased built up area of nearly 7000 sqft! To the left of the entrance foyer is the stairway, and to the left of this, adjacent to the garage is a large maids area and utility room, complete with en-suite. If you turn right from the stairs you enter the immaculately finished kitchen, complete with marble centre island, which then connects to the amazing, open-plan living, dining, and family area, with patio doors opening across the whole rear of the house to the garden. The garden has been flawlessly landscaped to include a heart shaped pool, connected to both Jacuzzi and swim up bar area, as well as plenty of open paved space for entertaining and a thatched gazebo. The 1st floor of this villa is just as impressive as downstairs, with the large master bedroom containing a terrace to take in the previously mentioned breathtaking views across the lake. This room also comes with walk in wardrobe and en-suite bathroom. The 2nd bedroom is also at the back of the house with its own terrace to take in the views and shares a bathroom with the 3rd bedroom. The 4th bedroom is at the front of the house and has its own en-suite. To view this unique villa, please call John on 052 774 2223 or email john@espace.ae.]]&gt;</description_en>

				<description_en>&lt;![CDATA[Espace is proud to present exclusively this exquisite B2 villa in the heart of Alvorada. Set on an open, imposing and impressive of over 10,000 sqft plot, this home represents undoubtedly one of the most prestigious residences in Alvorada. The upgrades on this home come together effectively to make this a "special property". Whether increasing the built up area (up from the standard 4,040 sqft to approximately 5,000 sqft) or the complete ground floor re-tiling with opulent large light marble tiles with discrete Greek key pattern, this is a home which will always impress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ground floor area has been enhanced in all the right places outwards towards the rear patio area from the main lounge, outwards from the dining area towards the Pool to incorporate a huge extra living space with access to the private Pool, plus incorporation of the external area by the kitchen to the garden to create an extra room or off-kitchen sanctuary (small family nook/crash area with full height sliding doors to garden). The external upgrades are equally impressive - befitting a prestigious home. Underfoot, the garden benefits from being laid with large soft surface light tiles over one half of the available space visually clean and unobstructed - perfect for gatherings and ideal for entertaining. A small illuminated water feature adds just the right atmospheric touch at the cool end of the day. Directly adjacent are the two centerpieces of the property landscape - an enclosed 40 ft private Pool with counter-current system for exercising with copious surround space for loungers and sunbathing and a purpose built Pool House with raised plinth and sturdy hard wood/fully glazed Pergola structure. The latter is truly a cool venue - perfect for family &amp; friends with a solid marble bar (fully plumbed) and of course with full A/C and comfortable seating with access to the pool, making you the envy of Alvorada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The upgraded foyer and staircase of this home create an immediate and unforgettable impression of quality. All of the villas four bedrooms are spacious and en suite - one of them downstairs, just off the foyer and is easily transformable into a comfortable study or office (enjoying private independent access to the Pool). The remaining three bedrooms are upstairs and are all spacious with great views around the property, especially over the Pool, Garden and Pool House. The 'majlis' or family space at the top of stairs between the bedrooms creates a perfect, intimate and informal family environment with space for settees to easily accommodate more than half a dozen people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The upstairs also benefits from the high standard of appointment seen throughout the rest of this home. The B2 Type has a quality, spacious Maid room situated off the kitchen corridor alongside the fully plumbed Utility space and additional cupboard space all leading to the garage area, which has 2 enclosed vehicle spaces with automatic controls. This is beyond question a home of prestige meriting early viewing. Please contact me, Patrick Henson, on 050-940-0865 or patrick@espace.ae to coordinate any viewing appointments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arabian Ranches is one of the most established Emaar developments, located in the tranquility of the desert on the Emirates Road, close to Dubai Land.

				<title_ar/>
				<description_en>&lt;![CDATA[Patrick and Espace Real Estate are delighted to bring yet another Exclusive Ranches Golf Course villa to the market. This ever popular 4-bedroom Type 16 is nestled on a big 8,500 sqft, enjoys sumptuous full golf course views and is truly a villa for outdoor entertaining. The plot has been fully landscaped with extensive quality lawn, large flower beds, flowering bushes and significantly enjoys a number of different mature tree types, which combine perfectly to create a real garden effect. The garden has a formally constructed seating area with excellent views over the Golf Course and alongside it is a large wooden frame open dove cage, which houses a small family of white doves who come and go throughout the day. On this side of the garden is the covered terrace seating/dining area - food service at no more than an arm`s length from the kitchen window and just a few feet from the BBQ area. On the other side of the Plot, the garden area runs uninterruptedly in the shade from the front of house wall to the garden/golf course edge. This would create the perfect place to sink a lap pool and make a real eye-catching statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indisputably, this villa will create fantastic memories for the family who deploy it for entertainment. Internally, the type 16 opens up with a superb open plan view from front to back of house - the vaulted front room ceiling creating a bright and airy feel to the main living areas. Long, single and double windows throughout the ground floor create great illumination. Alongside the kitchen is a spacious family room, which creates a less formal option for eating and watching TV. A removable gypsum wall has been inserted the two and would be easy to remove to create the full open plan space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Importantly for families with senior family members, this villa type has a downstairs en-suite guest bedroom. In close proximity is a second powder room. The maid`s room can be accessed from the kitchen or the garage and is adjacent to the enclosed utility area. Upstairs features the three other well proportioned bedrooms, the master being en-suite with walk in wardrobe and of course singular golf course views. The other two bedrooms are adjoining and share a Jack &amp; Jill suite. At the top of the stairs is a spacious landing area, which can be easily deployed as a study or small family area. There is an enclosed garage with electronic opening for a minimum 2 cars. Two water features (containing fish) embellish the small landscaped front garden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a villa in an outstanding location and awaits a family who love to entertain.

				<description_en>&lt;![CDATA[Very rarely available on the market, and ideally located in the sought after Meadows 6, this type 16 was extensively upgraded and enhanced. The standard type 16 is a five bedrooms villa, with a living area spread over three divided rooms, with a guest room downstairs and four upstairs, out of which two have en-suite bathrooms and two are sharing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This modified property presents an open plan living room, resulted from knocking down the wall in between the formal living area and the family room, effectively making use of space and enabling a smooth flow from the inside to the outside of the property. The kitchen is upgraded and in a very good condition, and the dining room next to it was kept as it was designed originally. The sliding doors at the back lead to the spacious plot of approximately 6,225 sqft on to a beautifully landscaped garden. The upstairs landing area is very spacious, and connects all the four bedrooms, ideal used as an additional family room. The bedrooms are spacious, and very well lit, with plenty of sun exposures with the master overlooking the community park. All bathrooms are in very good shape. For viewings, please contact Roberto at Espace Real Estate on 0553333724 or email roberto@espace.ae.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Meadows, part of Emirates Living, is one of the most popular and prestigious places to live in Dubai.

				<description_en>&lt;![CDATA[Espace is pleased to present exclusively the perennially popular Type 17 in the prestigious Mirador La Coleccion community - situated in a great position with Full Golf Course View. Set on a quiet edge of the Ranches Golf course, this luxury villa is also positioned towards the end of the cul de sac of the avenue, thereby guaranteeing little traffic. The visual appeal of the high vaulted living room ceilings is significant and with it the palpable cooling effect of the open space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Type 17 enjoys 5 bedrooms one of which is a spacious downstairs guest bedroom with adjacent bathroom suite - perfect for elderly family members who come to stay or easily transformable into a private study. The remaining 4 bedrooms are all upstairs, where: - 2 well-sized adjoining bedrooms share a Janet &amp; John style bathroom, another fully en suite bedroom provides excellent adult size accommodation and ultimately the Master bedroom, which is not only fully en suite but which enjoys 2 balconies - one of which could easily be used as a family sun bathing terrace or an 'al fresco' family eating area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Type 17 enjoys a built up area of  4,559 sqft. This villa is nestled on a comfortable well aired plot of almost 8,200 sqft with a beautiful private pool enjoying great privacy. The garden area is laid mainly to soft large smooth tiles but with mature trees and bushes, creating an impression of opulence with style. Alongside the private pool is a majestic Cape Reed pergola, creating the perfect shade for a family when it gets too hot whilst also providing dining space for over a dozen friends or family members - truly a versatile family entertainment space. The downstairs living areas of the Type 17 are generous open plan spaces and to complement this the current owners have removed the upper half of the rear wall of the kitchen creating an aperture, which enhances the feel of the kitchen space, opening up the rear family area (dining area) and creating a great service area between them. For families looking for that open style in their living spaces, the long windows, vaulted ceilings, open kitchen and family diner create a uniquely modern feel. The maid room and adjoining utility both lie in the corridor between the kitchen and its access to the garage - perfectly private for both parties. There is enclosed off-road parking for 2 cars with frontage parking for half a dozen vehicles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more information or to arrange a viewing please contact Patrick on 050-940-0865 or email me on patrick@espace.ae.&lt;br&gt;br&gt;Established in 2009, Espace Real Estate has grown from strength to strength.

				<description_en>&lt;![CDATA[Nick and Espace Real Estate are proud to present this rarely available, stunning property in Green Community MotorCity. Being one of only 48 bungalows in this development, there are always very few, if any, of these popular homes available to buy. Benefiting from a built up area of 4,200 sq ft and sitting on a plot of 9,766 sq ft, the bungalow has been very lovingly looked after by the present owners and is offered in great condition. There have been some upgrades done from the standard bungalow here, with upgraded tiling on the floors, tasteful German wallpaper throughout and additions to the kitchen adding to the feel of the property.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upon entering the home through the entrance hall, the spacious living room, sitting area and dining room are to the left and provide a great area for relaxing or entertaining. To the right is a hallway leading to the kitchen, with a guest bathroom and store room off this. The kitchen is spacious and ideal for family living, with plenty of room for a breakfast area and sitting room, great for those with children. To the rear of the property is a large hallway/lobby leading to the four bedrooms, each benefiting from being en-suite. To the side of the bungalow, there is a separate building with maid`s room, utility room, storage and pump room. There is also access from the rear of the garage, which has plenty of space for 2 cars. There is space all around this generous plot which has been carefully landscaped to provide a peaceful oasis consisting of colorful flora and relaxing sunspots. Viewing is highly recommended as once inside the bungalow, it is easy to see how perfect it is for a family home. Please contact Nick on 050 494 1068 or nick@espace.ae.]]&gt;</description_en>

Whilst not in the super league with its neighbor "Emirates Hills", 'Meadows' is undoubtedly a community, which houses a great proportion of the city`s movers and shakers. Within the hierarchy of Emirates Living, Meadows is viewed very much as the apex of the trinity of Meadows, Lakes and Springs. All the villas here are independent dwellings, ranging from three to seven bedrooms over two storey, all with balconies and private gardens, some with golf course or lake views and many nestled on large, beautifully landscaped plots. Meadows boasts 9 villages, but each with an absolutely unique identity. Meadows 1 &amp; 2 villages were generally endowed with a historical value premium as they were built at the head of the project and closest to the Sheikh Zayed Road and thus the most accessible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Meadows is a development created by Emaar Properties, the leading developer in the region. The corporate stability and good governance of Emaar are noteworthy factors in its continuing success bringing confidence to an expatriate buying public. The 9 Meadows communities all enjoy swimming pools, fitness areas, water features, play areas for children and parks and walkways to the local amenities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Espace Real Estate is one of the leading agents in the villa developments, specializing in the villa market for the past 8 years and concentrating all its efforts to guarantee quality service for both buyer and seller.]]&gt;</description_en>

This spacious villa enjoys a unique location, affording not only a triple lake view but which backs onto a large area of private greenery, walkways and lakes - unprecedented kerbside appeal. This type 1E villa enjoys 3 bedrooms plus maid`s plus downstairs study but the downstairs powder room is spacious enough to have had a shower added so the study could be deployed as an extra bedroom. The upstairs also benefits from a family room which has had doors fitted for privacy and which itself has been used as a guest (extra) bedroom. An excellent upgrade feature of this home is its own well sized private pool - the privacy achieved through prudent landscaping which has also created a restful appeal to the remainder of the garden area. This type 1E enjoys a built up area of just over 3,000 sqft and is set on a truly quiet plot of over 3,800 sqft. The views from the master bedroom balcony and back of the villa to the lakes are obviously excellent making this a real on-off property and the rear gate access to the walkways make this an unbeatable location.

Lakes continues to enjoy increasing popularity in recent years due to the villa and plot sizes being more spacious and less densely planned the most of Emirates Living. Over the last couple of years this has been contributed to elevated purchase and rental levels. Residents can be seen jogging around the lakes, or enjoying the swimming pools, squash courts and tennis courts within the Lakes Club; a popular health club with a restaurant and adjacent supermarket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Established in 2009, Espace Real Estate has grown from strength to strength.

There is a great amount of space inside this property and it is great for family living. With the garden and patio outside providing a safe enclosed space for children and a great entertaining spot for adults, this really is an ideal and affordable property for those looking for an idyllic location. Viewing is recommended as soon as possible, so please contact Nick on 050 494 1068 or nick@espace.ae for more information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arabian Ranches is one of the most established Emaar developments, located in the tranquility of the desert on the Emirates Road, close to Dubai Land.

				<description_en>&lt;![CDATA[Listed exclusively with Patrick through Espace Real Estate, is this superb value townhouse. Situated in the heart of Green Community East, this lovely villa backs onto a peaceful lane away from the perimeter and is less than a minute`s walk to the community pool and gym.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With an established built up area of around 4,200 sqft, the townhouse represents a great option for the medium-sized family requiring living space - 3 bedrooms plus study plus maid plus utility. The rear garden enjoys significant privacy due to mature landscaping, bordered with trees and shrubs and laid mainly to tile and shingle. The wide path between the garden of this villa and the adjacent gardens of the opposing street ensures an added layer of privacy. Upon entering the property is a large foyer, off of which are the spacious powder room and study. The study is often deployed as a fourth (guest) bedroom and is undoubtedly big enough. Beyond the initial welcome of the foyer area is the hallmark UP family lounge - long and deep with a full view out to the garden area of the villa - really inviting. Adjacent to it is the large kitchen with the maid`s quarters (and utility) lying just off this area with external access. The kitchen area opens out to the dining room space, which provides a large formal dining area and great views/access to the rear garden. Moving upstairs, the `Majlis` family living area opens up in front of you. It has direct access to a spacious balcony with great views. The 3 formal bedrooms provide great floor space for any family and enjoy the cool created by high vaulted ceilings. The master comes with a large walk in cupboard area and full en-suite. Bedrooms 2 and 3 each enjoy a bathroom (one en-suite and the other just ex-suite) - all the bedrooms enjoy very generous built-in storage. The Green Community retains evergreen popularity due to its location, quality of build and proximity to key amenities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This townhouse rests on a great plot of 4,036 sqft in a superb location and is extremely competitively priced so an early viewing is essential for the discerning purchaser. To organize a viewing please contact Patrick on 050 940 0865 or patrick@espace.ae.]]&gt;</description_en>

				<title_ar/>
				<description_en>&lt;![CDATA[Listed with Patrick through Espace Real Estate, is this great location townhouse in Green Community East. In excellent condition and situated in a prime access position, this peaceful corner villa backs onto a generous verdant pathway overlooking the pool and gym area - a truly great view. With an established mature landscaped garden, this plot enjoys the dual benefits of first floor balcony privacy (offered by mature trees) whilst the rest of the home is immersed in natural light. With a built up area of around 4,200 sqft nestled on a plot size of 4,003 sqft, this townhouse represents a great option for the medium-sized family requiring living space - 3 bedrooms plus study plus maid plus utility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upon entering the property is a large foyer, off of which are the spacious powder room and study. The study is often deployed as a fourth (guest) bedroom and is undoubtedly big enough for purpose. Beyond the initial welcome of the foyer area is the hallmark Union Properties Family Lounge - long and deep with a full view out to the garden area of the villa - really inviting - and its view beyond to the pool is picture postcard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adjacent to the lounge, is the large kitchen area (closed), which has just been upgraded with a modern brilliant-white suite. Leading from the kitchen corridor to the garage is the spacious maids (and utility) providing external/garage access. The kitchen area opens out to the dining room space - a large formal dining area with great views/access to the rear garden. The double enclosed garage has been converted into a movie centre but there remain 2 more full parking spots on the property plus half a dozen extra places on the other side of the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving upstairs, the `Majlis` family living area opens up in front of you and is the townhouse`s alternative family peace zone. It has direct access to a spacious balcony with excellent privacy. The 3 formal bedrooms provide great floor space complemented by high tipped ceilings. The master comes with a large walk-in cupboard area and full en-suite. Bedrooms 2 &amp; 3 each enjoy a bathroom (one en suite and the other just ex suite) - all enjoying generous built-in storage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Green Community retains evergreen popularity due to its unmatchable value for money at around AED1,000/sqft. The quality of build with proximity to key amenities is a big plus. This townhouse rests on a great plot of 4,014 sqft in a great location and is just extremely competitively priced - an early viewing is essential for the discerning purchaser.

Situated on a plot of 3,773 sqft and covering a built up area of 2,998 sqft, this property offers a comfortable, modern living space for a family. The type 1E townhouses benefit from an entrance porch leading to the family living room which in turn leads to the dining room and the fitted kitchen. Off the entrance lobby is a study which can double as a fourth bedroom and access to a guest bathroom and a maids room, with a door through to the garage. Upstairs there is a family living area, master bedroom with en suite bathroom, walk in closet and private terrace and the further two bedrooms which share a bathroom. br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Externally there is a landscaped garden which backs on to the park, so it is very private and perfect for children or entertaining.

				<description_en>&lt;![CDATA[Listed exclusively with Patrick through Espace Real Estate is this superb value, tranquil 1 bedroom en-suite apartment. Situated in the heart of Green Community East, this lovely apartment backs onto the peaceful green area of the main park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The building has only 3 floors, including private communal infinity pool with a well-facilitated private access gym, both just seconds from your own private rooms. The apartment also has a small private storage area and one fixed covered parking spot. This apartment truly benefits from its corner position on the building elevation and only has one neighboring balcony! The balcony view is perfectly private with trees and a garden area separating the building from the heart of Green Community East. With an established built up area of around 968 sqft, the apartment represents a great option for the investor or end user. Upon entering the property is a large foyer leading off to the spacious powder room with good large cupboard storage space just off the foyer. A short corridor leads into the spacious lounge area with the adjacent open kitchen with fixed utility points for an electric oven and washing machine. This great open plan space looks out onto the large balcony and beyond. The balcony is easily large enough for a suite of furniture. The single en-suite bedroom is virtually the same size as the lounge area with an enhanced bathroom space. Beyond the initial warm and demure welcome of this perfectly sized apartment are the advantages of privacy and peace - evident once the balcony doors are opened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Green Community retains evergreen popularity due to its location, quality of build and proximity to key amenities. This apartment has built up area of great plot of 968 sqft with a common area of over 1,500 sqft - matching maintenance fees are approximately AED 11,800 p.a. This apartment is vacant and can be viewed at short notice. Typical rental for this unit would be around AED 80,000 p.a. making it a great investment target. Early viewing is essential for this superbly priced apartment. For a viewing or information, please contact Patrick on 050 940 0865 or patrick@espace.ae.]]&gt;</description_en>

For more information or to arrange a viewing, please Ronald 056-2043832.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Meadows has always enjoyed a very favorable local reputation in Dubai as a premium residential project. Whilst not in the super league with its neighbor, Emirates Hills, Meadows is undoubtedly a community, which houses a great proportion of the city`s movers and shakers. Within the hierarchy of Emirates Living, Meadows is viewed very much as the apex of the trinity of Meadows, Lakes and Springs. All the villas here are independent dwellings, ranging from three to seven bedrooms over two story, all with balconies and private gardens, some with golf course or lake views and many nestled on large, beautifully landscaped plots. Meadows boasts 9 villages, but each with an absolutely unique identity. Meadows 1 and 2 villages were generally endowed with a historical value premium as they were built at the head of the project and closest to the Sheikh Zayed Road and thus the most accessible. The Meadows is a development created by Emaar Properties, the leading developer in the region. The corporate stability and good governance of Emaar are noteworthy factors in its continuing success bringing confidence to an expatriate buying public. The 9 Meadows communities all enjoy swimming pools, fitness areas, water features, play areas for children and parks and walkways to the local amenities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Espace Real Estate, we take pride not only in our in-depth knowledge of the market but also in the relationships we have nurtured with our clients over the last 4 years.

Second and third bedroom which share a bathroom and a family room. There is a great amount of space inside this property and it is great for family living.

The community, popular with many expat families with young children, offers a safe and secure gated environment away from the hustle and bustle of Dubai city life. Well known for its stunning desert landscape with relaxing environment and Golf Course, it is divided into 12 sub-communities. Each offers a different style of villa ranging from the 2 bedroom townhouses in Al Reem to the more spacious independent villas in Terranova and Hattan to name but a few. All of the projects feature their own community swimming pools, with tennis courts and park for the children. &lt;br&gt;The Ranches hosts the popular Jess School, Arabian Ranches Golf Club and a Village Community Centre featuring a medical centre, supermarket, dry cleaners, restaurants and other retail outlets.]]&gt;</description_en>
